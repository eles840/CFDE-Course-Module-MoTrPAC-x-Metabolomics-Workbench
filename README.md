# Integrative Metabolomics: A NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem workflow to extract and analyze metabolomics data sets from The MoTrPAC Study and the Metabolomics Workbench

## Overview
In this notebook, you will extract and analyze metabolomics data sets from two NIH Common Fund programs as part of the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem: MoTrPAC and the Metabolomics Workbench. As an example to analyze studies from multiple sources, this workflow is designed to extract data from rat exercise training studies and to analyze overlapping metabolites in heart tissue.

## Learning Objectives
1. Leverage Metabolomics Workbench API queries to find MoTrPAC and Metabolomics Workbench studies for multi-study analysis.
2. Compare and contrast data/metadata from candidate studies
3. Analyze results to find similar/opposing metabolites from comparable studies

## Notebook Outline
- **Setup:** install/import Python packages and set global parameters.
- **API connectivity:** confirm Metabolomics Workbench REST API access.
- **Study search:** identify MoTrPAC studies and candidate comparable rat exercise studies by keyword search.
- **Compare/contrast studies:** select MoTrPAC heart studies and one comparator study; review metadata and grouping structures; download and preview datatables; diagnose normalization/scale.
- **Harmonization & analysis:** identify overlapping metabolites; annotate with RefMet; compute within-study statistics and effect sizes; compare directional concordance; generate interactive comparisons.

## Requirements
### Recommended runtime
- Google Colab (Python 3)

### Python packages used (installed in-notebook)
- pandas, numpy, requests, scipy, statsmodels, seaborn
- matplotlib, matplotlib-venn (for overlap visualization)
- plotly (for interactive charts)

## Reproducibility Notes
- Metabolomics Workbench API responses can change over time as studies are updated; re-running the notebook in the future may yield different search results.
- Datatables can include QC/blank/standard rows; filtering logic in the notebook controls whether these are retained for analysis.
- Metabolite overlap based on datatable column names may require harmonization (e.g., RefMet matching) to improve comparability.

## Outputs
The notebook writes intermediate and result files under directories like:
- `./data/` (downloaded MW datatables and caches)
- `./outputs/` (analysis outputs and figures, if configured)
